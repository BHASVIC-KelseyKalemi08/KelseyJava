## Object oriented programming questions 
### 1) Define the term programming paradigm:

Is a style of programming
### 2) Explain the difference between object-oriented programming and procedural programming:

In procedural programming the subrouytines are defined separately meaning they have no relationships with eachother while in object oiented programming subroutines can be easily grouped together, having a relationship wit heachother.

### 3) Explain the difference between a class and an object:

a class defines the structure and behavior of objects, while an object is an actual instance of that class with its own specific characteristics.

### 4) Identify a situation where a static method may be used:

A static method in Java is a method that is part of a class rather than an instance of that class. Can be used to return certain values of that class.

### 5) Using pseudocode, write a class with relevant attributes and methods to represent a digital clock object. It should represent the time as a 24-hour clock, and include methods to create a new object, set the time manually, display the time, and update the time at the end of each minute

 class digital clock {
 private hours
 private mins

 public procedure new(startingHour, startingMin
  setTime(startinghour, startingMin)
  endprocedure

  public procedure displayTime(startingHour, startingMin):
  this.
